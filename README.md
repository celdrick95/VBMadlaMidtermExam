# VBMadlaMidtermExam
This VB.NET program asks the user to enter a username and password. If the correct credentials (“celdrick” and “@admin123”) are entered, it grants access and displays even numbers from 2 to 100 before ending the program. The user is allowed only three login attempts before the program closes automatically.
